# Learn to Program Javascript

## Why learn Javascript?

Being a developer it is overwhelming to learn multiple languages to build different kinds of applications. Most of the time we need to learn more than one language just to build a single application or to build various applications. For the frontend part, you learn a different language and for the backend one a different language. For mobile, you learn a different one, for game development you learn a different one. Every time learning a new language becomes quite confusing or sometimes frustrating for developers… Surely we all want to stick to one language that can perform pretty much any task.
So what’s the solution for the above problems? Can we just learn a single language and manage multiple things together? Is there any language that can fulfill most of the tasks? Is there any language that can be used everywhere…? Yes, there is…and that language is JavaScript.
